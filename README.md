TITLE:  A MODEL FOR CLOUD-BASED ACADEMIC ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (CAERP) FOR A HIGHER INSTITUTION

School of Computing and Information Technology, Kampala International University, Kampala - Uganda.

ABSTRACT

The concept of cloud computing though not so commonly used in Education, it was used for eLearning and not for integrated systems like ERP in Higher Institutions. An Enterprise Resource Planning system is an associate enterprise-wide computer code that has comprehensive practicality and permits integration of core academic processes in Higher Institutions. This study sought to develop a security and privacy model for migrating and implementation of a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning system in the higher education sector. Cloud computing demands that security and privacy issues like vulnerabilities, threats, attacks and solutions (mitigation and controls) are addressed. Hence, this paper discusses the said issues, solutions and categorizes them as either security-related, privacy-related or intertwined. The results suggested that there is a need to develop a security and privacy model for migration or implementation of a cloud-based ERP system in the education sector in Uganda. It is recommended that for an Institution to gain competitive advantage, top management trust and support, appropriate resource allocation and user training as well as their total involvement is mandatory. Hence, it is undeniable that Cloud-based ERP system promotes mobile computing, which is the ability to access resources from anywhere at any time.
